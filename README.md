# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Repository

Welcome to the **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** repository! This repository serves as a hub for various EDA projects, where each file represents an in-depth analysis of a specific dataset. The goal is to provide a centralized resource for EDA techniques, insights, and visualizations.

---

## üìã Overview
This repository includes:

- Comprehensive EDA projects across diverse domains.
- Visualizations and statistical analyses to explore datasets.
- Techniques for data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering.

Each EDA file is self-contained and provides detailed explanations of the steps performed, along with code and outputs.

---

### EDA Files
- Each EDA file is named descriptively based on the dataset or analysis performed.
- Example: `EDA Google play.ipynb` etc.
- You can all the Datasets on this link. - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ItTRLPmNcnEENo6-M3tRfWsdBgvXz_4T?usp=sharing
